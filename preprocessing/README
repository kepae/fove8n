Code for pre-processing individual frames

frTens.py gets the output of the first convolution of a pre-trained resnet-50 for each frame and saves it as a tensor so it doesn't have to be computed every time.

getOpticFlow.py gets the optic flow for each frame (relative to the previous frame) using RAFT

xy_fixed_r.py gets the label for each frame where x and y are a coordinate and r is a fixed radius of 25. x and y are generated using the optic flow data.
